# Getting Started

### 0. Invite the Bot & Set Channel Permissions

* **Invite the bot to your server:**
  * [Invite Link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1391865587185225868\&permissions=1126314371573824\&integration_type=0\&scope=bot+applications.commands)
* **Set up channel permissions:**
  1. Go to your desired channel's settings > **Permissions** > **Advanced Permissions**.
  2. Under **Roles/Members**, add the bot (e.g., `ESDT Tipping Bot`).
  3. Enable the following for the bot:
     * ✅ View Channel
     * ✅ Send Messages
     * ✅ Embed Links
     * ✅ Create Public Threads
     * ✅ Send Messages in Threads
  4. Ensure that users/roles who should interact with the bot can use **slash commands** in that channel.

> ⚠️ **These permissions are required for the bot to function properly!**
>
> **Note:** The "Create Public Threads" permission is essential for football betting, auctions, listings and lotteries features, as the bot creates threads for most activities.

### Prepare Supported Tokens List

* Make a list of all ESDT tokens you want the bot to support, separated by commas.
* Example: `WEGLD-bd4d79,USDC-c76f1f,REWARD-cf6eac,UTK-2f80e9`
* You will need this list when registering a project wallet.

### 5. Next Steps

* Ask your Community to register their wallets with `/set-wallet` command. This will create Virtual Accounts for the registered users.
