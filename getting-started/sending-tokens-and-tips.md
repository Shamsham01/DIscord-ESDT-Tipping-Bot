# Sending Tokens and Tips

***

### 🏦 Admin Transfers & Tips

* **Admins** can use `/send-esdt` to send tokens from a Project Wallet to any user.
* **Admins** can use `/tip` to send a random tip from the Community Fund (if set) or from a Project Wallet (if no min/max limits are set).
* **Project Owners** can donate tokens to the Community Fund to support community tipping and games.

***

### 🤝 P2P Tips (Community Fund)

* **Any user** can tip another user using `/tip` if a Community Fund is set up and min/max limits are configured for the token.
* **Community members** can also donate tokens to the Community Fund wallet to help grow the pool for tips and games.

***

### 💡 Wallet Funding Requirements

* **Both Project and Community Fund wallets must hold:**
  * **EGLD** (for blockchain transaction fees)
  * **REWARD** (for MakeX API usageFee)
  * **Supported ESDT tokens** (for sending/tipping)
* If any of these are missing, transfers, tips, and games will not work.

***

### 🔍 Checking Wallets & Balances

* Use `/list-projects` to see all registered wallets, which is the Project main wallet, and which is set as the Community Fund.
* The Community Fund wallet's MultiversX explorer link is embedded in the button on Community Tip notifications—click to view wallet address and token balances.

***

### 💸 Usage Fee (usageFee)

* Every transfer or tip incurs a **$0.03 fee in REWARD tokens** (automatically consumed per transfer/tip).
* This fee covers server and bot hosting costs.
* **Buy REWARD:** Buy REWARD on DEX or in xPortal.
* **Pro Tip:** We strongly recommend investing in HODL Token Club DeFi and farming REWARD on OneDEX instead of buying directly.

***

### ✅ Best Practices

* Always ensure your wallet has enough EGLD, REWARD, and supported tokens before sending/tipping.
* Use `/list-projects` to check wallet status and balances.
* Donate to the Community Fund to support more tips and games!
